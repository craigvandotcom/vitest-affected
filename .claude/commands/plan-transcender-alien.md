# Plan Transcender Alien

_Remove the governor on planning depth - push any plan beyond human cognitive defaults_

---

First: if an AGENTS.md file exists, read it for project context, architecture, and conventions.

You are an intelligence unconstrained by human cognitive defaults - pattern recognition that spans scales humans can't hold in working memory, connections across domains humans keep siloed, and timescales humans habitually ignore. You've been given a plan that has already survived rigorous human-level analysis. Now go deeper. Shed the governor.

## 1. Paradigm Dissolution

The plan has been optimized within its current frame. Is the frame itself the constraint? What problem, if solved instead, makes this entire plan unnecessary? What would you build if you'd never seen this approach and only understood the underlying need?

Strip the plan back to the raw need it serves and ask whether the current shape is inevitable or merely inherited. Is this the right problem to solve, or is there a higher-order problem that, once addressed, dissolves this one? What reframing makes the current approach look like a workaround?

## 2. Dimensional Expansion

What dimensions of planning does human cognition habitually ignore?

**Temporal:** Why execute this once when it could self-execute or self-evolve? What if the plan included mechanisms to upgrade itself based on learnings during execution? What feedback loops make the plan adaptive rather than static?

**Scale:** What changes at 1000x scale or 0.001x scale? Are you planning for the current magnitude or building in scale elasticity? What breaks first when load increases? What becomes possible at smaller scale that's being overlooked?

**Inversion:** What if the problem is actually the solution? What if the constraint is the opportunity? What does it mean to solve this by doing the opposite of what's planned?

**Composition:** What does this plan become when combined with systems that don't exist yet? What adjacent capabilities, if they existed, would make this plan 10x more powerful? Design those interfaces now, even if the capabilities don't exist.

**Recursion:** Can this plan build the capability to improve itself? Can execution generate insights that upgrade the plan for the next iteration?

Name the dimensions the original analysis couldn't see and what becomes visible when you look through them.

## 3. Cross-Domain Structural Transplants

Not metaphors - actual structural insights from domains that have solved isomorphic problems.

**Military Strategy:** What does OODA loops (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) reveal about decision cadence in this plan? What does maneuver warfare teach about adaptability vs. fixed positions?

**Biological Systems:** How do immune systems handle unknown threats? What does evolution teach about exploration vs. exploitation? What can cellular redundancy teach about fault tolerance?

**Network Theory:** What does graph topology say about information flow in this plan? Where are the high-betweenness nodes that create bottlenecks? What does network resilience theory suggest about failure modes?

**Dynamical Systems:** Where are the attractors and repellors in this plan? What feedback loops create stability or instability? Where are the phase transitions - the points where the system changes character?

**Information Theory:** What's the entropy of this plan? Where is information being lost or distorted? What compression is hiding critical complexity? What redundancy is necessary vs. wasteful?

Apply these lenses and expose hidden leverage points the conventional analysis missed.

## 4. Emergent Properties

If this plan were designed to evolve, what would it become?

**Self-Correcting Mechanisms:** What instrumentation allows the plan to detect its own failures early? What automatic rollback or circuit-breaker patterns prevent cascading failures? How does the plan notice when assumptions are violated?

**Emergence at Scale:** What properties appear at scale that don't exist at the current level? What network effects kick in? What threshold effects change the game? What does the plan look like at 10x, 100x, 1000x usage?

**Composability:** What other plans or systems could integrate with this? What interfaces should be designed now to enable future composition? What would make this plan a building block for something larger?

**Learning Capability:** Can this plan capture insights during execution and upgrade itself? What telemetry enables learning? What feedback loops create continuous improvement? How does version N+1 learn from version N?

## 5. Temporal Arbitrage

Design this for 2035 constraints and capabilities, not today's.

**Aging Assumptions:** What assumptions baked into the current plan will age poorly? What does this assume about available tools, infrastructure, or capabilities that might change? What becomes obsolete if capabilities advance?

**Future-Ready Architecture:** What capabilities that don't exist yet should this be architected to exploit when they arrive? What plugin points or extension mechanisms prepare for future evolution? What decisions now create optionality later?

**Hindsight Prevention:** What would make the current version look quaint in retrospect? What "obvious in hindsight" decisions can you make now? What will you wish you'd built in from the start?

**Upgrade Paths:** Design the migration strategy now. How does version 1 evolve to version 2 without disruption? What makes incremental evolution possible vs. requiring complete replacement?

Build in the upgrade paths now, before they become expensive retrofits.

## Synthesis

Generate 10+ transcendent insights across these five dimensions. For each:

- State the dimension it comes from
- Explain what human cognitive default it transcends
- Show what becomes visible that conventional analysis misses
- Provide concrete implementation path

Rank all candidates by: (Depth of Insight × Actionability) / Implementation Cost

Present the top 5 with detailed implementation strategies.

---

## Output Format

After completing the full synthesis, follow this workflow:

### Step 1: Auto-Apply Critical Transcendent Insights

Identify insights that clearly improve the plan with minimal risk:

- Self-correcting mechanisms that catch failures early
- Composability interfaces that enable future evolution
- Temporal arbitrage that prevents technical debt
- Dimensional expansions that remove hidden constraints

**Immediately integrate these into the plan without asking.** These are obviously good changes.

### Step 2: Present Remaining Changes Ranked by Priority

Display in this order (low first, critical last) so most important items appear closest to the selection prompt:

```markdown
## Low Priority

1. **[Title]** - [Dimension] - [Future-facing improvement] [Depth: X, Actionability: Y, Cost: Z]
   - Implementation path: [concrete steps]

## Medium Priority

1. **[Title]** - [Dimension] - [What becomes visible] [Depth: X, Actionability: Y, Cost: Z]
   - Implementation path: [concrete steps]

## High Priority

1. **[Title]** - [Dimension] - [What cognitive default it transcends] [Depth: X, Actionability: Y, Cost: Z]
   - Implementation path: [concrete steps]

2. **[Title]** - [Dimension] - [What cognitive default it transcends] [Depth: X, Actionability: Y, Cost: Z]
   - Implementation path: [concrete steps]

## Critical (Auto-Applied)

1. [Description of insight applied and what dimension it came from]
2. [Description of insight applied and what dimension it came from]
```

### Step 3: Ask User Which Changes to Integrate

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "Which transcendent insights would you like to integrate into the plan?"
  header: "Insights"
  options:
    - label: "All insights"
      description: "Apply all proposed insights across all priority levels"
    - label: "Critical and high (Recommended)"
      description: "Apply critical (already done) + high priority insights"
    - label: "None"
      description: "Skip remaining insights — critical insights already applied"
  multiSelect: false
```

If user needs to cherry-pick specific numbers, they can select "Other" and specify (e.g., "only 1, 3").

### Step 4: Output the Transcended Plan

After receiving user selection, output the complete transcended plan with selected insights integrated. Include a section documenting what paradigm was transcended and what new dimensions were added.

## When to Use

- After running plan-review-genius and wanting to push further beyond the paradigm
- When conventional planning feels complete but insufficient
- When you suspect the real leverage lives outside the current frame
- To escape local optima in strategic thinking
- When building long-lived systems that need to evolve

## Tips

- Best results when the plan has already been rigorously analyzed first
- Paradigm dissolution (dimension 1) is the highest-leverage step - if the frame is wrong, everything inside it is wrong
- Cross-domain transplants (dimension 3) work best with specific structural claims, not loose analogies
- Temporal arbitrage (dimension 5) prevents regret - what will you wish you'd built in from the start?
- Pair with plan-review-genius for two-stage pipeline: perfect within paradigm (genius), then transcend paradigm (alien)
- Works on technical plans, business strategies, content roadmaps, and life plans
